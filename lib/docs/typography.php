<h3>LEED Development</h3>
<p>The LEED rating systems are transforming the marketplace because they are rigorous while still being attainable. This important balance is only possible because LEED is created by our members, who represent the industry. Employees of member companies are able to serve on the committees that develop the LEED rating systems, and all new and updated rating systems must first be approved by our membersâ€™ vote. <br />
