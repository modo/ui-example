			            	<p>The LEED rating systems are transforming the marketplace because they are rigorous while still being attainable. This important balance is only possible because LEED is created by our members, who represent the industry. Employees of member companies are able to serve on the committees that develop the LEED rating systems, and all new and updated rating systems must first be approved by our members’ vote. <br /><a href="#" class="more-link small-link">More</a></p>

			            	<p>USGBC’s members-only committees and working groups are also central to the development of other programs and initiatives that support USGBC’s mission. From programming at Greenbuild to our work with building codes to our financial and governance policies, our member committees are at the core of everything we do at USGBC. USGBC’s Board of Directors is also made up of employees of member companies.</p>
			            	
			            	<p>Additionally, review of third-party educational programs for USGBC endorsement through the Education Provider network is done exclusively by employees of member organizations, who earn free LEED Professional Credential maintenance credit for their volunteer participation. <br /><a href="#" class="more-link small-link">More</a></p>
			            	
			            	<h3>Networking</h3>
			            	<p>The most important work done in support of USGBC’s mission is the result of the partnerships formed among our members. Through exclusive online and in-person networking opportunities, you’ll meet other members who can help you grow your business.</p>
